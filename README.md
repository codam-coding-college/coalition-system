If you're a student and want to contribute to this project, talk to the staff about it first to figure out what is possible and discuss implementation ideas.

## Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Fill the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (don't forget to change the POSTGRES_HOST in the PRISMA_DB_URL variable to localhost)
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run build` to build the project
5. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
6. Run `npm run start` to start the server and seed the initial database
7. Optional:
	- run `node build/dev/create_quiz_questions.js` to seed the database with initial questionnaire questions
	- run `node build/dev/create_rankings.js` to seed the database with initial rankings
	- synchronize some data from Intra using the Webhook Catch-up tool in the Admin interface

### Reseed the database
1. Delete the *.sync-timestamp* file in the root directory
2. Run `npm run build && npm run start`

### Add initial questionnaire questions
Run `node build/dev/create_quiz_questions.js` after running `npm run build`
