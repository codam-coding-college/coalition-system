// TODO: DO NOT COPY INTRA'S SYSTEM!
// BUILD YOUR OWN, CUSTOM DATABASE STRUCTURE THAT SUITS CODAM'S NEEDS.
// THEN FIND A WAY TO PASS OVER THESE SCORES TO INTRA WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THEIR CALCULATION SYSTEM.
// All calculation rules can be deleted from the bloc 20. Calculations will be done on our side.
// We do however need to set the deadlines correctly, so that they are in sync between Intra and this coalition system. Perhaps fetch them from Intra to make sure?

// Would be nice to be able to import old existing scores to look at past leaderboards. The fact that we're gonna use a new system should not matter. Make it backwards compatible with Intra!

// The amount of points given on Intra should always be in the 1000s so that it can easily be divided by the amount of active participants in the coalition system to get the coalition average.
// This way we can use a mock account to remove the neccessary points from each coalition to balance things out (the students will see their total amount of points contributed, but
// if they go to the coalition scores overview on Intra, they will see the balanced scores).
// EXAMPLE: when a student scores 1200 points for their coalition and the coalition has 300 active participants, remove 1200 / 300 * 299 = 1196 points from the coalition total for this score.
// This point reduction can be done by a mock Intra account, just give a negative score of -1196 to this user. This mock user takes the hits for all students :')
// TODO: one caveat with this is that if the amount of participants changes, we'd have to balance out all scores again. Maybe do this daily? The graph on Intra will be a bit weird, but it's the only way to keep it balanced.
// Perhaps only recalculate when a new participant joins!
// EXAMPLE: the coalition has 1.000.000 points in total, with 250 participants. Old average was then 4.000 points. New participant joins, total is now 1.000.000 + 1000 = 1.001.000, with 251 participants. New average is 3.984 points. Remove 16 points on the mock user.
